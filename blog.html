	    	 <p> On the other hand, the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages, for example, dependence on new technology. Man no longer needs to think. Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer makes mental calculation and no longer works his memory. The decline of human capital implies an increase in unemployment. In some areas, devices can replace the human mind.The use of technology certainly needs rule and new laws. For example internet use is an individual freedom. However, the invention of the atomic bomb cannot be an individual freedom. In fact, regulations are difficult to implement when these technologies are introduced â€“ such as regulation surrounding the impending arrival of autonomous vehicles.Finally, as most technological discoveries aim to reduce human effort, it would imply that more work is done by machines.This equates to less work for people: the human is becoming ever so obsolete by the day, as processes become automated and jobs are made redundant.
